# Preview hitsounds

The editor plays hitsounds as the music clock crosses converted Catch objects. Windows
uses a separate WASAPI mixer; macOS uses AVAudioPlayer voices. Music playback remains
the source of the playhead position. Pausing, seeking, changing maps, or closing the
window stops active hitsound voices. Seeking does not play the skipped interval.

| Catch object | Sample |
| --- | --- |
| Standalone fruit | Normal plus whistle, finish, and clap flags |
| Slider head, repeat, tail | The corresponding edge flags and sample banks |
| Droplet (slider tick) | `slidertick` |
| Tiny droplet / slider body | Silent; no looping slide or whistle sound |
| Banana | Dedicated built-in banana sound |

## Sample selection

`HitsoundResolver` reads the object's preserved `.osu` line, including FSliders converted
from imported sliders. Timing points provide the sample bank, custom index, and volume;
nonzero circle sample values override them. Legacy slider hitSample fields supply banks;
their index and volume follow timing. Normal, soft, and drum banks are supported. Addition
bank zero follows the normal bank. Slider edge settings select samples independently for
the head, repeats, and tail. An explicit custom filename replaces the normal layer
and retains enabled additions, matching lazer's legacy parser.

Resources are resolved relative to the source map directory, or the audio directory for
a new document without a source map. Lookup is case-insensitive and limited to indexed
files inside that directory, excluding symbolic links. For an enabled custom sample index,
lookup checks `.wav`, `.ogg`, then `.mp3`; index 1 has no numeric suffix, while higher
indices use names such as `soft-hitclap2.wav`. Index zero selects built-in samples.
Missing, invalid, or oversized audio falls back to an original synthesized preview sound.
The original synthesized fallback sounds distinguish object kinds, banks, and additions. Imported skin audio is not currently used.

Both backends retain a bounded sample cache and allow up to 32 simultaneous voices.
Source files and managed decoded buffers are limited to 16 MiB per sample; each cache
is limited to 64 MiB. macOS passes WAV/MP3 data to AVAudioPlayer and decodes OGG into
PCM WAV. Samples in the upcoming second are warmed before starting playback and
periodically during playback. Uncached samples decode on demand. Dispatch follows the
host's transport polling cadence; clock jumps larger than 250 ms discard stale events.

## Maintenance

Keep sample selection in Core and transport boundary handling in the shared editor.
Platform players own decoding, mixing, native handles, and disposal. Hitsounds must not
modify beatmap content, undo history, or the music clock. Keep Catch rules separate from
osu!standard slider-body audio rules.

`HitsoundTests` in the shared App suite covers bank/index/volume inheritance, explicit
filenames, path isolation, slider edges, silent tiny droplets, bananas, simultaneous
objects, pause/resume, seek, and replay. Mac native tests exercise custom WAV/OGG samples
and stopping voices with their output muted. The device-free Windows audio suite
(`--hitsound-check`) compares mixed PCM, gain, clipping, custom WAV decoding, and stop
behavior, and runs in Windows CI. Run the affected suites and both platform
builds as described in [Testing](TESTING.md). Native device tests keep application output
muted without changing system volume.
